# Minimum-Cost-Network-of-Computers

This project deals with the Greedy Algorithm approaches. The goal of the project is to create a Minimum Cost Network of Computers (MCNC) for Al-Hilal Saudi company. Given a connection cost of every pair of computers that can be connected (there may be pairs of computers between which no direct connection can be built), AlHilal company aims to connect every computer with another either with a direct connection or via a sequence of connections with a minimum total cost. The computer network must satisfy the following hard constraint: Al-Hillal possesses two supercomputers that must be directly connected due to the high frequency and quantity of messages exchanged between them.

This project is done by us as part of the **Graph Theory course (CS403)** - supervised by **Prof. Hachemi Bennaceur**
